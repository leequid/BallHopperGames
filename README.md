# BallHopperGames
Practice low coupling and high cohesion

Used same Ball Hopper class and Ball class to program NBA draft simulator, Lottery, and Bingo game.
NBA simulator is based on 2016 draft pick teams. It will add different amount of balls for each teams and pick randomly to see who gets to pick first.
It will simulate 100 times and give you a stat of it
Lottery is based on powerball rules. 5 white balls are picked and 1 ball is picked after adding the balls to the hopper and shuffling.
For bingo, you have an option how many boards you want to play. The board is randomly generated. When a ball is picked and there is matching number on the board, it will mark.
It goes through an algorithm to check the win condition to check row and column and diagnal every turn. If there is a match, the game indicates that one of the board won!
